# 101 sync with Garry (HR)

## Notes
* Garry is based in New Jersey
* Available to be the intermediator between me and Velocity

## Impressions
* Weird interaction about Drivenets being like family, and I telling him that at
Netflix they don't use that analogy quoting:
> You don't fire your kid if he is underperforming

* Garry suggested in a later meeting to MC that it would be nice to me to have a
onboarding buddy, the chosen one is David.

## Followup
* Let Garry know that I am travelling to Brazil, (and working from there)
