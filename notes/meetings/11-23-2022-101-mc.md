# 101 sync with MC before thanksgiven holidays

* [people to talk to](#people-to-talk-to)
* [next steps](#next-steps)
* [Mental Notes](#mental-notes)

## people to talk to
* iyal (how do I spell this?)
> generalist, knows everything

* dima raitsis
> dima loves that people recognize his work, read some of his documentation before
> reaching out
`https://drivenets.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CS/pages/3310256185/HLD+-+Management`

* larry cole (IT)
> he guy that has been handling my aws requests, and likely the one I will be 
> interacting with in the future

* david 
> which is helping with terraform and will be my onboarding buddy

## next steps
1. Release nautobot in production (us-east-1)
    * SSO ? (MC)
    * Netbox vs Nautobot sync?
    * Terraform ? (David) (eu-west-2)
    * skaffold - working on it

2. Metrics
    * Decision to be made by Dec 20th
    Service Node metrics go to DNOR via gmni, and we would like to source the metrics 
    directly instead. There is a risk we can uncover untested bugs by doing that. 
    * POC
        * discover metrics directly from service nodes via gnmic
        * compare to metrics from DNOR

## mental Notes
* Dmitri is the sole user of Netbox 
* NCMON == LIBRENMS
